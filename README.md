## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Dheeraj and here is some information about me:

Currently looking for a full-time opportunity in robotics software: perception and sensor fusion systems in mobile robots and manipulation. I am also interested in working on real-world problems using computer vision algorithms for different fields of applications.

### Current personal projects:
- Application of Moveit in ROS2 to understand skills and its use for extracting object information for manipulation
- Using VIO and behaviour trees for robot perception, navigation, and action planning in mobile manipulators

### Recent Work
- Implementing BundleSDF on industrial parts with irregular object geometry for optimal object pose extraction.
- Experimenting with vision pipelines for use in a Voxposer setup
- Replicating OwlVit algorithm for an industrial use case.
- Completed my Master's Thesis at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart on Combining Vision, Force Control and Reinforcement Learning for the task of gear assembly
- Developed a multimodal system in the perception of a robot manipulator in an assembly line.
- Created a data-efficient system capable of training the Reinforcement Learning model quickly with quick deployability

### My Career Interest
I am interested in using learning-based systems with scene understanding for robots like mobile manipulators in inspection and disaster rescue. To this end, I have been developing my skills in manipulators, mobile robots, and robot perception through internships and personal projects. 

Some of the topics I have worked on are:
  - Multi-sensor fusion
  - Visual Reinforcement Learning
  - Robot perception for navigation and manipulation
  - Optical Flow, Visual Odometry, Depth Estimation
  - Synthetic Data Generation
  - Object pose estimation
  - Mechatronic systems
  - Robot body and circuit design and prototyping 

### Education background
- I am a Master Student of Robotics Systems Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany
- I completed my Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur

### Technical Experience
- Languages: Python (Pytorch, Tensorflow, Stable Baselines, Gym, MuJoCo), C++, Embedded C
- Tools: NVIDIA Isaac, ROS, Docker, WANDB, MATLAB, LaTeX, Blender
