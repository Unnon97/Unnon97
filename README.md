## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Dheeraj and here is some information about me:

### Current Status
Looking for an internship and/or a full-time opportunity in robotics software: perception and sensor fusion systems in mobile robots and manipulation. I am also interested in working on real-world problems using computer vision algorithms for different fields of applications.

### Recent Work
- Completed my Master's Thesis at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart on Combining Vision, Force Control and Reinforcement Learning for task decision-making 
- Developed a multimodal system in the perception of a robot manipulator in an assembly line.
- Created a data-efficient system capable of training the Reinforcement Learning model quickly with quick deployability

### My Interests:
My long term interest is to build a learning based system for a mobile manipulator robot. The system would use perception algorithms and multi-sensor fusion to understand its location in its neighbourhood and to estimate object pose to manipulate in an area of disaster rescue. Therefore, I am building my knowledge by working on different modern computer vision, sensor fusion and motion planning systems in different real world applications such as mobile robots for terrestrial surroundings, manipulation robotics for assembly and ego motion understanding for mobile robots. These applications help me gain vital understandings about structured setups for different mobile and manipulation robots.
Some of these topics are:
  - Multi-sensor fusion
  - Visual Reinforcement Learning
  - Robot state representation
  - Optical Flow, Visual Odometry, Depth Estimation
  - Synthetic Data Generation
  - Object pose estimation
- Mechatronic systems
- Robot design and prototyping 

### Education background
- I am a Master Student of Robotics Systems Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany
- I completed my Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur

### Technical Experience
- Languages: Python(Pytorch, Tensorflow, Stable Baselines, Gym, MuJoCo), C++, Embedded C
- Tools: NVIDIA Omniverse, ROS, Docker, WANDB, MATLAB, LaTeX, Blender
