## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Dheeraj and here is some information about me:

Currently looking for an internship/work student or a full-time opportunity in robotics software: perception and sensor fusion systems in mobile robots and manipulation. I am also interested in working on real-world problems using computer vision algorithms for different fields of applications.

### Current self-projects
- Application of Moveit in ROS2(Humble) to understand skills and how they could be combined with visual representation of object pose and perform manipulator motion which could help in developing concepts of embodied AI for robot manipulation
- Concepts of Behavior Tree in application of Nav2 for mobile manipulation robot projects

### Recent Work
- Completed my Master's Thesis at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart on Combining Vision, Force Control and Reinforcement Learning for task decision-making 
- Developed a multimodal system in the perception of a robot manipulator in an assembly line.
- Created a data-efficient system capable of training the Reinforcement Learning model quickly with quick deployability

### My Career Interest
My long-term interest is to build a learning-based system for a mobile manipulator robot. The system would use perception algorithms and multi-sensor fusion to understand its location in its neighbourhood and to estimate object pose to manipulate in an area of disaster rescue. Therefore, I am building my knowledge by working on different modern computer vision, sensor fusion and motion planning systems in different real-world applications such as mobile robots for terrestrial surroundings, manipulation robotics for assembly and ego-motion understanding for mobile robots. These applications help me gain a vital understanding of structured setups for different mobile and manipulation robots.

Some of the topics I have worked on are:
  - Multi-sensor fusion
  - Visual Reinforcement Learning
  - Robot state representation
  - Optical Flow, Visual Odometry, Depth Estimation
  - Synthetic Data Generation
  - Object pose estimation
  - Mechatronic systems
  - Robot body and circuit design and prototyping 

### Education background
- I am a Master Student of Robotics Systems Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany
- I completed my Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur

### Technical Experience
- Languages: Python(Pytorch, Tensorflow, Stable Baselines, Gym, MuJoCo), C++, Embedded C
- Tools: NVIDIA Omniverse, ROS, Docker, WANDB, MATLAB, LaTeX, Blender
