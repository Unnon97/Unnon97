## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Dheeraj and here is some information about me:

### Current Status
Looking for a full-time opportunity in robotics software: perception and sensor fusion systems in mobile robots and manipulation. I am also interested in working on real world problems using computer vision algorithms for different field of applications.

### Recent Work
- Completed my Master Thesis at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart on Combining Vision, Force Control and Reinforcement Learning for task decision making 
- Developed a multimodal sytem in perception of a robot manipulator in assembly line.
- Created a data-efficient system capable of training Reinforcement Learning model quickly with quick deployability

### My Interests:
- Robot perception, localisation and decision making systems:
  - Multi-sensor fusion
  - Visual Reinforcement Learning
  - Robot state representation
  - Optical Flow, Visual Odometry, Depth Estimation
  - Synthetic Data generation
- Mechatronic systems
- Robot design and prototyping 

### Education background
- I am a Master Student of Robotics Systems Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany
- I completed my Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur

### Technical Experience
- Languages: Python(Pytorch, Tensorflow, Stable Baselines, Gym, MuJoCo), Embedded C, C++
- Tools: NVIDIA Omniverse, ROS, Docker, WANDB, MATLAB, LaTeX, Blender
