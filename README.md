## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Dheeraj and here is some information about me:

Currently looking for a full-time opportunity in robotics software: perception and sensor fusion systems in mobile robots and manipulation. I am also interested in working on real-world problems using computer vision algorithms for different fields of applications.

### Current personal projects:
- Application of Moveit in ROS2 to understand skills and its use for extracting object information for manipulation
- Using VIO and behaviour trees for robot perception, navigation, and action planning in mobile manipulators

### Recent Work
- Using BundleSDF for object pose extraction for gripping industrial parts with irregular object geometry.
- Experimenting with vision pipelines for use in a Voxposer setup
- Completed my Master's Thesis at Fraunhofer IPA, Stuttgart on Combining Vision, Force Control and Reinforcement Learning for task decision-making 
- Developed a multimodal system in the perception of a robot manipulator in an assembly line.
- Created a data-efficient system capable of training the Reinforcement Learning model quickly with quick deployability

### My Career Interest
My long-term interest is to build a learning-based system for a mobile manipulator robot. The system would use perception algorithms and multi-sensor fusion to understand its location in its neighbourhood and to estimate object pose to manipulate in an area of disaster rescue. Therefore, I am building my knowledge by working on different modern computer vision, sensor fusion and motion planning systems in different real-world applications such as mobile robots for terrestrial surroundings, manipulation robotics for assembly and ego-motion understanding for mobile robots. These applications help me gain a vital understanding of structured setups for different mobile and manipulation robots.

Some of the topics I have worked on are:
  - Multi-sensor fusion
  - Visual Reinforcement Learning
  - Robot perception for navigation and manipulation
  - Optical Flow, Visual Odometry, Depth Estimation
  - Synthetic Data Generation
  - Object pose estimation
  - Mechatronic systems
  - Robot body and circuit design and prototyping 

### Education background
- I am a Master Student of Robotics Systems Engineering from RWTH Aachen University, Germany
- I completed my Bachelors Degree in Mechanical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur

### Technical Experience
- Languages: Python(Pytorch, Tensorflow, Stable Baselines, Gym, MuJoCo), C++, Embedded C
- Tools: NVIDIA Omniverse, ROS, Docker, WANDB, MATLAB, LaTeX, Blender
